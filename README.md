# Drakula
## Yet another Dracula theme for Discord

![Drakula v3.2 running in Goosemod alongside some other mods](/ast/FrontPage-v3.png)

# About
This is Drakula, a Discord theme that focuses on delivering a comfortable user experience to users that may be accustomed to using terminals for their communication needs (say through SDF, IRC, Email, etc) while maintaining as many vanilla elements from the original Discord client as possible.

Drakula is a fork of [Zeno Rocha's Dracula BetterDiscord theme](https://github.com/dracula/betterdiscord) with mods and snippets to make it as minimalistic and cozy as possible for terminal users that want to use Discord while having a familiar workspace.

# Added modifications
The following mods to Discord have been added for your own pleasure:

1. Change default font to Montserrat 
2. Change default status badge thingy colours
3. General UI colour changes
4. Code Blocks have proper Synthax Highlighting
5. Scrollbar for long custom statuses
6. Removing the text from the general server pop-up (its now only icons!)
7. General pop-ups like Server Names and such colour tuned to fit the Dracula colour scheme
8. HTTPS and HTTP differentiators!

# Installation
Installing Drakula is pretty simple and intuitive, just follow these steps for your mod of choice:

If you're using GooseMod (recommended), just search up for Drakula in your "Themes" section and hit "Import"

If you're using BeautifulDiscord, just run `beautifuldiscord --css (place where ur repo is)/Drakula/Drakula.css` (remember to replace the "place where ur repo is" part).

If you're using another client mod (say BetterDiscord, Vizality, Powercord, Astra etc), Install the theme like you usually do, just note that I will ***not*** be offering any support for other clients not mentioned above.

# License
Drakula is licensed under the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org).

Some components used are part of the Public Domain.

# Notes
Due to how GooseMod works, the `powercord_manifest.json` file is still on the repostiory. You're still allowed to use Powercord but note that if something breaks or anything, I'll not offer any kind of support unless its something that may affect other supported client mods (BeautifulDiscord or GooseMod).

Due to my incompetence as a developer that isn't really a developer, the following things are not colored properly/are broken:
- Switch Accounts popup
- Explore Public Servers section
- Add Server popup
- Changelog popouts (Goosemod, Powercord, Discord and other clients)
- Join Hypesquad quiz
- A bunch of popout thingies that I forgot
